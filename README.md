# Radiance cascades

This project aims to implement a 2D sandbox using the (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6v1_7HY2X-LV3Ofb6oyTIxgEaP4LOI6/view)[radiance cascades] method.

The project only exists for educational purpose :
- To discover the rust vulkan API, (https://vulkano.rs/)[Vulkano]
- To discover Vulkan principles
- To discover the new GI process method _radiance cascades_

That said, this project may not be used in production since it does not reach any performance requirements.

# Roadmap

- [ ] Implement the rendering _"Hello world"_ triangle
- [ ] Implement basic 2D editing
- [ ] Implement radiance cascades method (may be CPU first ?)
- [ ] Implement radiance cascades method on GPU
